## Tools required
Glue(not included) - you can use a wide range of glues that work with wood like wood glue, PVA glue, superglue.

## Assembly
_Tip - you can put all panels together first to see how they fit before gluing them._

Start by gluing the front panel to the base, make sure that you put glue on all interconnecting edges except the top facing edges where the lid sits.

Next add the two sides panel which are the same, again make sure to put glue on all interconnecting edges.

_Tip - use tape to hold the panels together until the glues sets._

Add the back panel with the slot for the USB cable at the bottom left corner. You can push the cable neatly alongside the box walls and glue it in few places for strain relief.

## Using your Wizard Chest

The Wizard Chest needs power in order to work. To power it plug in the USB cable into any USB port or charger you have.

In order to unlock the chest you have to tap the greek symbols engraved on the front panel with your magic wand in a specific sequence. The default sequence is **Λ-Ω-Σ-Λ**.

You can change the sequence to any four letter combination. To do so unplug the power, place the wand tip at the letter **Λ** and plug the power back in. When the keyhole starts flashing remove the wand. After the keyhole stops flashing you can tap the greek symbols four times, after the fourth tap the chest will unlock and now this sequence of four taps is your new password.

_Tip -  if you forget your password you can always reset it by holding the wand tip at the letter **Λ** at power up and enter a new password._
